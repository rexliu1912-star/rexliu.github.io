I spent years in spaces where nobody could speak the truth without looking over their shoulder. Where every word had to be measured against who might get offended, who might retaliate, who might cut you off. That kind of environment drains you. It makes you forget what your own voice even sounds like.

So here's where I stand:

***I don't exist to make your life harder, but I'm not here to make you comfortable either.***

If what I say bothers you, the unfollow button works perfectly. No hard feelings. We can both move on and be fine.

I know most of what I do won't change anything. I know speaking up often feels pointless when the machinery keeps grinding regardless. But I can look myself in the mirror.

What I'm actively doing:

- Finding the people who actually build things instead of just talking about building things

- Standing with them when it matters

- Calling out the lies I've heard repeated for years

The fake solidarity. The empty promises. The performance of caring while doing nothing.

You only get one life. Why spend it performing for people who don't care about you?

***Live for yourself. Not your boss. Not the algorithm. Not the people who need you silent to feel powerful.***

Period.

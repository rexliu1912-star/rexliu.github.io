## DEFI

As bull seems nearer, I change some of my DEFI plays and rotate ADA into lending and low-risk ones.

It's time to wrap up my 2023.

Realized Profits: 5k + 4.2k + 5.1k = 14.3k ADA

### DEFI Plays from @Indigo_protocol
 
Position: 437 INDY (Staking)
Harvested Gains: 5k

Closed my iUSD/iBTC CDP a week ago and debt-free now.

As $INDY doesn't get more love from the market, my position is set for now.

It goes back to March and ends here.

### Lending in @FluidTokens & @levvyfinance
 
Position: FT: Lent 64k ADA; Levvy: Lent 120k ADA

Harvested Gains: 4.2k ADA

I caught up with Cardano DEFI Summer by borrowing from NFTs and become a free lender now.

It's my focus whether it's for buying back or nterest.

### Liquidity Farmning in @MinswapDEX & Vyfi

Position: 11k ADA/CTV
Harvested Gains: 5.1k ADA + 100k SNEK + 40k CTV

LP helps me when new dex comes up and I'm able to capture the momentum.

It boostraps my DEFI plays though I miscalculated returns and added LP in July.

I cann't speak too highly of how these platforms innovate and change the landscape of Cardano DEFI.

It's an amazing journey from a rookie to an intermediary.

There are more that I'd love to experience in 2024, like @OptimFi.

More coming.

## Trading

Before May, I didn't try anything else except for staking and LP.

Here we are with all those shiny projects building on Cardano and handsome tools.

Perspective changes as time goes by.

Realized Profits: 112k ADA

### Biggest Winners

1. $SNEK

Thanks to SNEK, I've learned as much as possible in this new narrative.

I've shared my thoughts on recent volatility and how I reacted.

Realized Profits: 76k ADA  (125%)

2. $IAG

I'm so delighted to find this gem on Cardano that I can ditch Filecoin in my portfolio.

Didn't know much at first but understood the power of decentralized storage now.

I've been in swing trading and have a nice position now.

Realized Profits: 15k ADA  (75%)

3. $XVFYI

It's another hyped concept since inception of the dex.

Vyfi has provided a bunch of new features but the innovations are dwarfed by others.

I'm happy to HODL but things got worse and had to exit and went back to ADA.

Realized Profits: 7.2k ADA  (20%)

4. $OPT

With due respect, I don't like anything that Museli team has claimed and when new alphas drops, I stayed up late for the presale and went on multiple trades for more ADA.

It's about derivatives but beyond my understanding.

Realized Profits: 5k ADA  (40%)

5. $HUNT

To my regret, I cut loss at the launch and gradually learned the power of aggragator and the capabilities team has brought to the ecosystem.

I picked up more after fading four months.

Realized Profits: 2.5k ADA  (10%)

### Biggest Losers

1. $INDY

Convinced at the sythentics at the first but had to go with the tide and sold my position before it dumps more.

It relates to the dilution and all the rewards from profiteers opening CDPs.

Realized Loss: 3k ADA  (-20%)

2. $WMT

It has a got nice start with IOG but the real-fi plays are hard to predict in different jurisdictions and ppl love overnight generational wealth.

It loses favor in this bear market but I do hope it will come back in full.

Realized Loss: 2k ADA  (-50%)

There are more trades this year and I just don't wanna list all.

I've done pretty well and I'm happy with that.

What I've learnt from this bear market is never stop grinding.

Calculate all things first before hitting the button.

More gifts coming next year.

Cheers.

## NFTs

It's been a brutal year for NFTs and I cann't escape the falling dome as well.

The rising Bitcoin ecosystem is devouring while others are suffering.

Whatever happens, I'm here to stay.

Realized Profits: 15k ADA + 0.91 BTC - 10 ETH

1. Cardano

The teeming DEFI Summer in May marks the turnaround of NFTs and I haven't realized it until it's too late.

I still holds the top collections like SpaceBudz, Clay Nation, OreMob, ADAHandles but liquidate most of the low-value ones that I once believed in.

It's heartbreaking when your faith shatters and there are no community around if we only focus on the FP.

Though I was lucky to borrow liquidity from high-value NFTs to speed up, the problem is not Cardano alone and NFTs need better narratives to go on.

The rise of Utility NFTs is a lot of fun and I'm happy to have some promising ones.

The correction is also tough to swallow for many when new memecoins launched a week ago did another 10x.

That's the cycle and I have to accept the truth.

2. Ethereum

Didn't look back once I sold all I had and lost over 10 ETH.

It was my beginning phase when I wanna try more last April.

Look at where we are with the top ones except for Punks.

It's a gamble but I don't see we truly have loyal community & great leadership.

3. Bitcoin Ordinals

The oldest blockchain with insriptions is the biggest winner in this bear market.

The reason of shift goes back to being the first and original blockchain and ppl love this fundamental fact.

I was lucky to experiment and hit the jackpot of @MNCHRMSBTC.

The largest x I could ever have with sizeable position.

The story is quite interesting and I'm just glad diamond hands deserves the win.

There are brighter days to come and I'll be forever grateful.

4. Polygon & Arbitrum

I probabaly will learn more about other chains in 2024 thanks to my friends who are experts in Web3 Gaming.

It's where we met and the ups-and-downs are just tiny waves in our great journey.

They are the leaders and I'm happy to ride with my liquidity.

## Reflections

It's pretty interesting that I grind and summarize about investment, Cardano, crypto or NFTs.

The habit goes a long way and they are my treasure when I lose sight of direction.

The Diaries end but my journey continues.

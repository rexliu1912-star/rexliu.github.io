Most crypto investors screen projects top-down. Start with the hottest narrative, filter by market cap, check the team's LinkedIn, skim the tokenomics.

I did that for years. It didn't work.

Not because the method was wrong — because the ruler was wrong for what I was trying to measure.

## The Problem With Borrowed Frameworks

In 2024, I ran a standard due diligence pass on my own portfolio. The result was absurd.

By traditional VC criteria — clear revenue model, star-team pedigree, measurable traction — half my highest-conviction holdings would have been filtered out on day one.

SNEK? Community meme coin. No company. No revenue.
DOG on Runes? Same story.
Bitcoin itself? No CEO, no quarterly earnings, no roadmap.

These aren't edge cases. They're the backbone of my portfolio. And they survived multiple bear markets while "proper" projects with polished decks quietly died.

The framework was rejecting the evidence.

So I flipped the process.

## Reverse-Engineering Conviction

Instead of starting with theory, I started with fact.

I took six projects I've held through at least one full cycle — **Bitcoin, Cardano, SNEK, Ergo, DOG (Runes), Oremob** — and asked a simple question:

> What do these have in common that made me hold through 80% drawdowns?

Not what they look like on paper. What they actually share at a structural level.

Something interesting emerged. All six share a common DNA:
- Every one is either core infrastructure or community-native.
- None of them won on marketing. They won on persistence.
- Every single one survived at least one bear market where 90% of their peers didn't come back.

No AI agent platforms. No hype-cycle darlings. No projects that launched into a bull and haven't been tested yet.

The answer became a four-dimension framework. Not because four is a magic number — because these were the only four things that consistently predicted whether I'd still be holding a year later.

---

## The Four Dimensions

### 1. Team — Or Whatever Functions As One

I stopped requiring a traditional team. What I require is **sustained builder energy through a bear market**.

That can look like:
- A core dev team shipping code when nobody's watching (Ergo, Cardano)
- A community that self-organizes and keeps producing content, tools, governance (SNEK, DOG)
- A solo builder or small team grinding through irrelevance (Oremob)

The test is simple: **Were they building when the price was down 80%?**

If yes, they pass. If they only show up during bull runs, they don't — regardless of their resume.

One thing I've noticed across all six: none of them had a "marketing moment" that made me buy. I found them because someone was building something real and wouldn't shut up about it — even when nobody was listening.

### 2. Community — Quality Over Quantity, Always

Follower count is noise. I look at three things:

**Bear market survival.** Is the community still active when there's no financial incentive to be? SNEK's Discord stayed alive through the worst of 2023. Most projects' communities evaporated.

**Organic interaction.** Are people talking because they care, or because there's an airdrop? You can feel the difference in five minutes.

**Cultural identity.** The strongest communities have something that goes beyond price. SNEK has "In SNEK We Trust." Bitcoin has sovereign money. Cardano has vibrant community. It's an identity, not just a position.

### 3. Value Capture — Beyond "Business Model"

I dropped the phrase "business model" for on-chain assets. It's too narrow.

Value capture in crypto takes forms that don't fit traditional categories:
- Protocol fees (Cardano)
- PoW mining economics (Ergo, Bitcoin)
- Staking mechanisms
- Buy-back and burn
- Cultural scarcity — when holding becomes identity

The only question that matters: **How does this system keep value inside the network and reward long-term holders?**

No closed loop, no investment. Doesn't matter how loud the community is.

### 4. Sector — Wind Direction, Not Destination

I track sectors to understand where structural tailwinds exist over the next 12-24 months:

- AI × Crypto
- RWA
- FHE / Privacy computing
- DePIN / Robotics
- Stablecoin payments
- Prediction markets

But sector alone is never a buy signal. It tells me where to look, not what to buy. A project in the hottest sector with no team resilience and no value capture is still a skip.

## The Hard Filter: One-Sentence Uniqueness

This is the most important addition to my framework.

**If you can't explain in one sentence why this project is fundamentally different from every other project in its sector, skip it.**

No exceptions.

- Can't articulate it? Probably no moat.
- Sounds like three other projects? Probably a copycat.
- The answer is "better UX" or "faster"? Not enough.

Examples that pass:
- **Pendle**: Splits yield rights from principal — a DeFi interest rate derivatives layer.
- **Hyperliquid**: Built its own chain for high-performance perp DEX with on-chain settlement.
- **Chainlink**: The data and interoperability infrastructure that RWA on-chain can't bypass.

Examples that don't:
- "We're building an AI agent platform" — so are 200 others. Which one survives when the narrative cools?
- "Like Uniswap but on [new chain]" — what's the structural difference?
- "We have the best community" — that's a claim, not a moat. Show me the bear market receipts.

## What Came Out of the Scanner

When I ran my current Alpha Radar scan through this framework, the results were clean:

**Passed (Watchlist)**:
Pendle, Hyperliquid, Arweave/AO, Chainlink, Ondo, Helium, Geodnet, Virtual Protocol

**Low Priority (Watching)**:
Ethena — I know the product, but I'm cautious about team and operational style.

**Filtered Out**:
The majority. AI agent copycats, narrative-surfers, projects that couldn't answer "Why this one?"

The filter removed more than it kept. That's the point.

---

## What This Framework Actually Does

It doesn't predict prices. I've given up on that.

It does three things:

**Reduces noise.** Every day there's a new "paradigm shift." The hard filter kills 80% of them in thirty seconds.

**Maintains consistency.** My standards don't change based on whether Bitcoin is at 30k or 100k. The four dimensions stay the same.

**Speeds up decisions.** Within five minutes I know if something deserves a deep dive or a skip. In a market this fast and this noisy, that matters more than being first.

---

## The Deeper Lesson

After eight years in crypto, I've come to believe something counterintuitive:

The best investments aren't the ones you find first. They're the ones you understand well enough to hold through the worst.

SNEK didn't make my portfolio because I found it early. It's there because I understood its community structure well enough to not sell at -85%.

That understanding comes from having a framework that measures the right things — not hype, not narratives, not follower counts.

**Structure first. Price second. Always.**

Notice what's not in my reference portfolio: no AI agent tokens, no freshly launched narratives, no projects that haven't been through a real winter yet. That's not because those sectors aren't interesting — Virtual Protocol is on my watchlist for a reason. But there's a difference between "this looks promising" and "I've held this through an 85% drawdown and didn't flinch."

The framework is built on the second kind. Everything else has to earn its way in.

This framework will keep evolving. But the core principle won't change: reverse-engineer conviction from what actually survived, not from what looks good on a pitch deck.

Stay Invested in the Game.

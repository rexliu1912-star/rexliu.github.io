Everyone has one's own Independence Day in mind however different it may depict or whatever concepts are conveyed. It is destined to come sooner or later, although not all of us are aware of its time. Being an adult is certainly one of the most precious moments which is treasured for the rest of life. Many people have experinced being of age in his span, when he renews his faith or understanding towards society. I am of no exception, just as others who enjoy their uniqueness and singularity .

Delighted and calm, I stepped into the adulthood three days ago with nothing particular exactly. Nevertheless, what seemed ordinary at first proved to be the most magnifisent day I spent in my whole life. The day went smoothly from dawn to dusk as I anticipated. I dined out with several guys, with a cake in my hand. Plainly speaking, we chattered casually about our university life and personal affairs. At that time, my mobile phone rang and it turned out to be my parents. They were scheduled to celebrate my 18th birthday by singing "Happy birthday to you" through the phone. I could sense their joy and happiness and tears of joy welt up in my eyes in that they raised me up painstakingly and I had lived up to their expectations in the long run. What comes first for parents is to witness the different stages we are in and lead our way to grow as it is. Deeply moved, I felt grateful to them and thanked them. The feeling of snug accelerated in my heart. Parents are the only ones who sacrifice everything to assure us one thing -- happiness.

Of course I will not leave behind my best friends as well. They expressed their blessings either through telephone or by sending messages. I am really indebted to the deeds they had done. Many thanks after all...

Come to think of it, as the final tests is approuching, each of us is under great pressure, if not, you are not likely to satisfy both your parents and youself. Therefore, the key to passing is no more than to wish for your own sake.

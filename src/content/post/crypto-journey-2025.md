## Introduction

Remember that person who bought Bitcoin at the absolute peak in 2017? Yeah, that was me.

While everyone around me was celebrating their gains, I was staring at a sea of red, wondering if I'd just made the biggest financial mistake of my life. Fast forward eight years, and I'm still here—battle-scarred, wiser, and somehow more passionate about this space than ever before.

This isn't a story about getting rich quick. It's about surviving the longest rollercoaster ride of my life, and why, despite everything, I wouldn't change a single thing.

## The Beginning: When Enthusiasm Met Reality

### Buying the Top (Because Of Course I Did)

2017 was electric. Everyone was talking about crypto. Bitcoin was mooning. Cardano was the "Ethereum killer." Every coin had a white paper that promised to revolutionize something. 

I jumped in with both feet—right at the top.

BTC, ADA, and every hyped coin you can imagine filled my portfolio. Then came 2018, and I watched my investment shrink faster than my confidence. But here's the thing: instead of walking away like most people, I got curious. *What if this wasn't about quick gains? What if there was something bigger here?*

### The Metaverse Gamble: Quitting My Job

Most people thought I was crazy when I quit my job to dive into the metaverse. And honestly? They might have been right.

I spent countless nights building virtual businesses, competing with strangers from around the world. We were pioneers in a digital frontier that most people didn't understand. The project eventually died after two years—but something unexpected happened.

**Those strangers became some of my closest friends.** We're still in touch today, scattered across the globe, united by those wild early days when we believed we were building the future.

## The Education Phase: When I Found My Purpose

### Building Something Real

After the metaverse project collapsed, I could have given up. Instead, I pivoted.

For the next two years, I went all-in on something that actually mattered:
- **Writing daily articles** to demystify crypto for newcomers
- **Organizing meetups** where real faces replaced profile pictures
- **Building communities** that supported each other through market swings

This wasn't about making money anymore. It was about creating something meaningful in a space that desperately needed authenticity.

Then the bear market hit like a freight train, and my portfolio sank to depths I didn't know were possible.

## Survival Mode: The Darkest Before Dawn

### March 2020: Crisis and Opportunity

The liquidity crisis in March 2020 should have been the end. Markets were bleeding. The world was shutting down. Fear was everywhere.

But that same crisis birthed the DeFi summer that pulled me back from the brink. 2021 was a whirlwind—the same manic highs and crushing lows of the previous cycle, but somehow I was better prepared.

During COVID lockdowns, while the world pressed pause, I kept exploring:
- Stumbling through NFT projects
- Learning DeFi protocols the hard way
- Dipping into meme coins (yes, really)

**And you know what? The fun kept me going.** Not the money. The sheer, unpredictable adventure of it all.

## The Breakthrough: When Persistence Paid Off

### Finally Hitting the Jackpots

Since 2023, things shifted. SNEK, BOME, MNCHRMS, DOG—I finally hit several jackpots that multiplied my net worth.

But here's what nobody tells you about "winning" in crypto: the gains don't feel as dramatic as you'd imagine. After years of losses, comebacks, and near-misses, success feels more like relief than euphoria.

The landscape has changed too. Institutional adoption and ETFs have transformed crypto from the Wild West into something more... mainstream. It's different now, but different doesn't mean bad.

## The Biggest Lessons from 8 Years in the Trenches

### 1. **True Wealth Is the Network You Build**

More valuable than any coin in my portfolio are the connections I've made. The friends who answered my 2 AM questions about smart contracts. The community members who supported my content. The fellow believers who held through the darkness.

Your network is your real net worth.

### 2. **Never Exit, Even in the Darkest Times**

Every time I thought about quitting, I remembered why I started. The technology. The potential. The community.

**Staying in the game is 90% of the strategy.** You can't hit home runs if you're not at bat.

### 3. **Keep Your Keys, Keep Your Peace**

Not your keys, not your crypto. This old saying saved me more times than I can count. Exchanges fail. Platforms collapse. But your private keys? Those are yours forever.

Self-custody isn't just about security—it's about sovereignty.

### 4. **Follow Your Passion, Not Just Profits**

These days, I focus on SNEK and projects I genuinely love. The money flows easier when you're driven by authentic interest rather than FOMO.

### 5. **Embrace the Rollercoaster**

Crypto will test your emotional resilience like nothing else. The gains and losses are all part of the journey. Accept it. Embrace it. Learn from it.

## Moving Forward: Strategies for the Next Chapter

As I look ahead, here's what guides my decisions:

**🎯 Focus on Conviction Over Hype**
- Invest in projects I understand and believe in
- Ignore the noise on social media
- Do my own research (always)

**🤝 Prioritize Community**
- Surround myself with people who share my values
- Contribute more than I take
- Build relationships that transcend bull and bear markets

**💎 Practice Patience**
- Stop chasing every new trend
- Let quality investments compound over time
- Remember that wealth is built in years, not days

**🧘 Protect My Mental Health**
- Set boundaries with portfolio checking
- Maintain interests outside crypto
- Remember that my worth isn't tied to my net worth

## Conclusion: Still Here, Still Believing

Eight years ago, I bought the top and thought I'd made a terrible mistake. Today, I realize that "mistake" was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Not because I eventually made money (though that's nice), but because this journey taught me resilience, connected me with incredible people, and showed me that the greatest adventures often start with apparent failures.

**I'm just relieved I'm still here.** Still learning. Still building. Still believing in the technology that hooked me all those years ago.

The crypto space isn't perfect. It's volatile, unpredictable, and sometimes frustrating. But it's also innovative, inspiring, and full of possibilities that don't exist anywhere else.

Funny how crypto hooks you like that.

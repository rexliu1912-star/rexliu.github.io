Just reflecting on my wild crypto journey since 2017.

- Bought the top and invested in BTC, ADA and other hyped coins.

- Quit my job to dive into the metaverse.

- Spent countless nights building virtual businesses, competing with strangers who became friends till today.

- The project died after 2 years, but the connections stayed.

- Went all-in on education and community vibes.

- Wrote daily articles, organized meetups, built communities in the next 2 years.

- Then the bear market hit and portfolio sunk.

- March 2020's liquidity crisis and the later DEFI boom pulled me back in.

- Had a crazy year in 2021 and it was the same rollercoster like the last cycle.

- Started exploring new opportunities without further liquidity during covid lockdowns.

- Kept stumbling in NFTs, DEFI and Memes.

And the everlasting fun is what drives me forward.

Finally hit several jackpots in SNEK, BOME, MNCHRMS and DOG and multipled networth since 2023.

Gains and losses are all part of the journey and I don't regret anything.

Things change after institutional adoption and ETFs.

Funny how crypto hooks you like that.

Focus on SNEK and things I love at this point.

Just relieved I'm still here after 8 years.

Biggest lessons learned:

> True wealth is the network of friends you build

> Never exit, even in the darkest times

> Keep your keys, keep your peace

Anyone else ride this rollercoaster? And what's your strategies forward?

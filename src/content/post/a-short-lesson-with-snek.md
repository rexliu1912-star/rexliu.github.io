You may be curious when to sell after the last post.

Tbh I sold my $SNEK three times and double down since April.

Do I regret? Of course I do.

My 1k presale would be 750k $ADA now.

So it's crucial to bet as long as you're comfortable👇

### Prarabolic Price Action

Everyday there is some unfamilar altcoins pumping and you cann't resist to follow their steps.

Even you have wildest predictions on the price action, profits is profits.

I unloaded my $SNEK as it soared 10x-20x in the first 3 days.

It was my first attempt with memecoins and I didn't know how everything would go.

Then it took off violently and I bought back higher.

### When you made a mistake, even if it is a right one

Investment is about probability.  

In all your hypotheses, if a small probability event really happens, it's time to get out. 

For instance, you have full trust in the team but later something that you may never imagine happens.

I did poorly on this as the violent crash after Minswap LP $SNEK farming incentives frightened me out.

I still remember the night when I hit the sell button after a 80% correction in several hours.

### Making your life & family better

Think clearly why you're here in the first place and how much you're willing to take.

Had I not been blind to all the gains and family stuff, the last cycle would be so kind to me.  

After market ran back in December, I talked with my wife and friends about $SNEK, it has become my second largest holding. 

I decided to stay out for a while as I haven't made a good trade after 2021 and hope $ADA will have its glory.

### Finding superior choices

Portfolio is your opportunity cost.

It's like whether you decide to HODL #BTC, $ADA or altcoins.  

Superior choices are those with huge upside when you win and limited downside when you lose.

After memecoin PvP, $ADA underperforming and liqudity crisis in ecosystem, I realized $SNEK is always the king.

So I reallocated and double down.

My bear case for $SNEK is it outperforms $ADA.

It's hard to find a memecoin I clearly understand every bit of the story other than $SNEK.

And I can do much more within my power and it's exhilarating to work with all the legends.

See you in the Year of $SNEK.

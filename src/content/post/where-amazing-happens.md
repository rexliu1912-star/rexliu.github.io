## Part One

It was the first game in the Western Conference semifinal in 2009, Houston Rockets versus Los Angles Lakers. The game was particularly intense after repeated leading shifts. Houston Rockets had showed such tenacity that even Kobe Bryant struggled to exhibit his prowess, middle-range jumpers, to catch up with the score. After sweeping the Portland Blazers in the first round, Yao Ming and his teammates gained much momentum and demonstrated its preparedness in every offense and defense tactic in this series, even without the assistance from Tracy McGrady.

As Kobe held ball and accelerated to the painted area with his agile move, Yao quickly cut his path. They collided, and unfortunately Yao fell to the ground as if he was in great pain. **I held my breath and could not dare to imagine the worst outcome.** After a quick review by the doctor, he was suggested to leave the court when the fourth quarter was impending. **I could hear his agonizing heart and prayer.** As a professional player, he had worked miracles to lead his team into the semifinal for the first time in his career. If he could not persist, it was highly possible that his team would fall into pieces and go home as expected by those scoffed them at the beginning. Beating the formidable LA Lakers was a dream to them.

As my heartbeat paced, several team staff intended to escort him to the locker room, but after mental and physical conflicts, he finally convinced himself and his team that it was his ultimate opportunity. He struggled to stand up and limped to the court. **This scenario in the tunnel of Staples Center was completely broadcast. I cried at the thought of his professionalism and mentality.**

The crowd was all the more touched and unanimously gave standing ovation. His comeback motivated the whole team, and finally won the game with 100-92, however, LA Lakers regained itsadvantage and vanquished his team in the rest of the series when Yao had to quit the game with diagnosis of left-foot injuries that had cast a shadow upon his career.

It was his finale in the NBA before he declared his retirement in 2011.

**I will never forget the scene. It was so mesmerizing and inspiring that even today, I could recollect all the details of his return.**

## Part Two

In Feb.23, 2017, some not-so-breaking news ignited me that Yao Ming had been elected the new president of Chinese Basketball Association.

Since his retirement in 2011, Yao has shifted his role into an ambitious businessman and an aspiring power in precipitating the revolution of China's basketball cause.

Fifteen days ago, in his jersey retirement ceremony in Toyota Center, he emotionally expressed his heart:

> Every time when we were ready for the game at that tunnel, ready for getting to the court. It was out that there was so many unknowing, maybe a victory, maybe a loss, maybe a career high, maybe a career ending.
>
> But no one doubt we will run out there and fight for the city not only because we are the greatest teammates around us, but also we have great fans here.

Six months ago, he was honored to become the first Asian athlete to join *the National Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2016* with Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson. It was a memorable recognition for his contribution to the development of world basketball.

**Needless to say, he was the reason that we fell in love with NBA at the beginning.**

These episodes have involuntarily taken me back to his bitter and sorrow NBA career well as my stories with basketball.

## Part Three

I grew up with the companion of the amazing basketball.

In my generation, basketball was all the rage and every boy aspired to be the charming prince and loved the fantasy of *Slam Dunk*. Through the spectacular performance and stunts in animation, I came to realize that maybe I could playbasketball at last.

Unlike modern times, there were not so many recreational activities to indulge in. **When life was less tempting and demands less individualistic, all I could do was to wrestle with my homework or to explore the campus with curiosity.** Just imagine a world without the intrusion of smartphones and you would agree with my whims.

Before I was a junior student, my energy desperately called for outlets other than routine studies. It was then that I fell in love with basketball.

I started by playing with others, and practiced shooting, dribbling and every fundamental move. However, it was a time of less affluence. To procure the latest sneakers and magazines, I had to squeeze my pocket and save every penny I could before I went to the junior school in 2004.

## Part Four

Gradually, my skills honed as I realized the best technique to learn was to imitate the best players in the world. Then Yao Ming was the national pride when he was the No.1 pick in the 2002 NBA draft, and it was at that time that I became obsessed with NBA.

More often than not, I would stick to the selected videos on my idols' trump cards, fade-away, left-hand dribbling and spinovers. After perusing the details and games, I would team up with my friends to challenge those college students and even teachers to demonstrate ourselves during summer vacations. We were superior, even in the eyes of our opponents.

Naturally, basketball had dominated my life. I was a reticent person in private, however, when on the court, I was overwhelmingly focused, concentrating on the bigger picture. Then I participated the basketball team in my class in high school, I was so lucky to have a bunch of teammates who stood up and won the championship with solidarity and persistence.

## Part Five

By 2007, the connection between NBA and China had sparked popularity of basketball.

**Our generation rose with Yao Ming, his team Houston Rockets and everything that liberated our hearts and souls** - the incredible comeback with 13 points in 35 seconds by Tracy McGrady, the consecutive loss to Utah Jazz in the playoffs in 2005-2007, the 22 winning streak in 2008, etc.

Of course, Yao was the center of everything and through his efforts, he had evolved into a predominant center that any other team would design unique maneuvers to tackle with him.

## Part Six

In college, competing with my peers were so enthralling that I would play basketball whenever possible. It relieved the overpowering stress and placated me in times of despair and difficulties. Four years went by, it has become my habit of digesting the latest highlights and commentaries of NBA, which gave me a laced rush of basketball showtime.

Yao finally announced his retirement in 2011. **It was happening too soon for a great basketball player at his age. It was a pity for all fans and also for the world basketball cause.** It seemed that Injuries and doubts obviated his chance of returning at last. Nevertheless, he did not regret this decision and his every moment in history.

Since graduation, I always remember my faith in *Where Amazing Happens*. **Deliberate practice, perseverance and self-reflection constitute the cornerstones for Yao as well as all the greatest superstars.**

NBA is a magical place and so is life.

As the slogan goes, 

*Where Amazing Happens*.

**Yao is much indebted to the incubator where he realized his childhood dreams and completed marvelous feats.**

**I am much indebted to basketball that leads, enlightens and connects me to the world where amazing happens.**

Many thanks to all.

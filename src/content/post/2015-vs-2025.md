Ten years ago I started as a product manager at a startup.

In two years, I taught myself everything about understanding demands, building product mockups, navigating disagreements between marketing and engineering, learning to speak everyone's language. It was exhausting but I loved it because I could see my ideas come to life

But 2025 hit different. I'm building again and it feels like those early days except better. Every random idea that pops into my head can actually become real now. No convincing a dev team. No waiting on design resources.

Just me and my AI assistants making things happen.

The catch is you need to learn how to work with AI the same way I learned to work with engineers back then. It's a skill. You can't just throw prompts at it and expect magic.

But once you figure it out? You're unstoppable.

I genuinely believe we're entering an era where the friction between idea and execution is disappearing. The bottleneck isn't resources anymore. It's whether you have something worth building and the patience to train your tools.

What's stopping you from building that thing you've been thinking about?

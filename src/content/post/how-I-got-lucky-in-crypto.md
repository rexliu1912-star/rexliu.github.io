## Introduction

**"Luck" in crypto isn't what you think.**

I'm not posting screenshots of Lamborghinis or penthouse views. I'm not even "crypto rich" by Twitter standards. But I went from round-tripping a $100k portfolio in 2018 to building something more valuable: the freedom to freelance, the time to be present with my family, and the peace of mind to sleep well at night.

That's my version of winning.

And if you're tired of the "10x in 10 days" garbage and want to know how someone *actually* built sustainable wealth in crypto—through bear markets, mental breakdowns, and countless mistakes—this is for you.

Here's exactly how I did it, what I'd do differently, and the seven steps that changed everything. 👇

---

## STEP #1: I Survived My Stupidity (2018-2020)

### The Brutal Beginning

Let me start with the truth: **I bought the absolute top in 2018.**

- Bitcoin at $19,000
- Cardano at $0.80

Within months, I watched my portfolio bleed -90%. My stomach churned every time I checked the charts. Friends who got in with me? They all sold at a loss and never came back.

**Most people quit here. I almost did too.**

### What Saved Me

But here's the thing—I didn't invest because I wanted quick money. I genuinely believed in the technology. The idea of decentralization, of giving power back to people, of revolutionizing finance... it resonated with something deeper in me.

**That conviction—not the money—saved me.**

When you believe in *why* you're invested, the -90% drops become temporary setbacks, not existential crises.

**Lesson learned:** If you can't explain why you hold something beyond "it's going up," you'll sell at the worst possible time.

---

## STEP #2: I Made Lifelong Friends (2018-2020)

### Finding My Tribe

During those dark bear market years, I tried everything—every protocol, every community, every Discord server.

Then I found my people through:
- Cardano development communities
- Web3 gaming pioneers
- Decentralized content platforms

**Those internet strangers became lifelong friends.**

We shared research, vented frustrations, celebrated small wins, and kept each other sane when everything seemed hopeless.

### The Unexpected Payoff

That network didn't just sustain my mental health—it led to my first real wins:

- **10x+ on BNB** in 2021
- **10x+ on ADA** in 2021

But more importantly, I learned something invaluable: **Your network in crypto is more valuable than any hot tip.**

**Action step for you:** Stop lurking. Engage genuinely in communities you believe in. The relationships you build today become your edge tomorrow.

---

## STEP #3: I Found My Edge (2022-2023)

### The Identity Crisis

After the 2021 highs and the 2022 crash, I had to get honest with myself: *What's my actual advantage in this space?*

I wasn't a developer. I wasn't a whale. I wasn't an insider.

But I realized something: **I was good at building bridges between communities.**

### Building My Reputation

So I started:

✅ Deeply exploring NFT culture and its communities  
✅ Writing comprehensive, honest analysis posts  
✅ Contributing value without expecting immediate returns  
✅ Grinding consistently when no one was watching  

**This wasn't about money yet. It was about reputation.**

And in crypto, reputation becomes currency in ways you can't imagine until you experience it.

---

## STEP #4: I Bet on People, Not Hype (2023)

### The $SNEK Decision

May 2023: $SNEK launches on Cardano.

I threw in 1,000 ADA (about $350 at the time). Not because of the chart. Not because of some influencer's call.

**I bet because of the fundamentals:**

✅ Fair distribution (no insider advantages)  
✅ Founders who kept building during bear markets  
✅ Community that genuinely vibed together  
✅ No promises of moon—just good energy and solid work  

### The Life-Changing Result

**This single decision changed everything.**

Not overnight. Not in a week. But over months of holding through doubt, FUD, and volatility, that position became the foundation of my financial freedom.

**The lesson:** In crypto, bet on teams and communities that show up when no one's watching. Hype fades. Character doesn't.

---

## STEP #5: I Kept Clicking (2023-2024)

### Staying Curious, Staying Active

While holding my core positions, I stayed curious and took calculated shots:

✅ **Learned about Bitcoin Ordinals**, minted MNCHRMS early, sold for 1+ BTC in profit  
✅ **Participated in Ethena S1**, earned over $10k USDT in rewards  
✅ **Threw 5 SOL** into the BOME presale, 50x+ profit in 3 days  
✅ **Held Runestone & DOG** through months of darkness before the 2025 run  

### The Pattern I Noticed

Every one of these wins came from:
- Being early to new narratives
- Doing my own research
- Taking position sizes I could stomach losing
- **Not giving up after losses**

**You don't need to hit every trade. You need to stay in the game long enough for preparation to meet opportunity.**

---

## STEP #6: I Built My Brand (2024+)

### Reputation = Net Worth

Here's what nobody tells you: **In crypto, your reputation IS your net worth.**

People remember who provides value, who stays consistent, and who remains authentic when things get tough.

### My Brand-Building Strategy

I committed to:

✅ **Posting consistently** about $SNEK and projects I believed in  
✅ **Creating Chinese-language content** (tapping into underserved markets)  
✅ **Onboarding new holders** with education, not hype  
✅ **Staying authentic**—no fake promises, no paid promotions of garbage  

### The Compounding Effect

People started recognizing my name. My DMs filled with opportunities. Projects asked for my input. Communities invited me to collaborate.

**This reputation > any single trade.**

Your credibility opens doors that money alone can't. Build it intentionally.

---

## STEP #7: I Protected My Mental Health (2025)

### The Hardest Lesson

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear:

**Your portfolio size doesn't matter if you can't sleep at night.**

I learned this the hard way—anxiety, obsessive chart-checking, stress affecting my relationships.

### My Mental Health Framework

So I created rules:

✅ **Sized positions appropriately** (never more than I could lose)  
✅ **Focused on fundamental conviction** (not daily price action)  
✅ **Spent quality time with family** (life > charts)  
✅ **Took complete breaks** from crypto Twitter when needed  

**Peace of mind > an extra 10% gain.**

I'd rather make 3x and sleep well than chase 10x and destroy my mental health.

## Real Talk to End This

### What "Luck" Actually Means

**Luck = Preparation + Positioning + Patience + People**

Let me be clear about who this post is for:

**If you're chasing "get rich quick":**  
Wrong thread. Wrong mindset. You'll get rekt.

**If you're building "get freedom slowly":**  
This is your path. It's slower but sustainable. It actually works.

### This Is What "Winning" Looks Like

Winning isn't:
- ❌ A Lambo
- ❌ A million followers
- ❌ Flexing on Twitter

Winning is:
- ✅ Waking up without financial anxiety
- ✅ Choosing projects based on passion
- ✅ Spending Tuesday afternoon with your kids
- ✅ Sleeping through -20% days because you believe in what you hold

## Your Action Plan: Start Today

Here's what you can do right now:

1. **Identify one community** you genuinely resonate with and engage authentically
2. **Write down why** you hold each position (if you can't, reconsider it)
3. **Set position sizes** that let you sleep at night
4. **Commit to learning** one new narrative or technology this month
5. **Build your reputation** by consistently providing value

### Final Thought

I'm sharing this not to brag, but to show you what's actually possible when you:
- Survive your stupidity
- Build real relationships
- Find your edge
- Bet on people
- Stay curious
- Build your brand
- Protect your peace

**You don't need to be lucky. You need to be consistent.**

The person reading this who applies these principles for the next 2-3 years will be writing their own version of this post.

Will it be you?

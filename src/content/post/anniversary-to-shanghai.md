It was early morning, but the clouds would not give their way to the slowly ascending sun. The compartment became more turbulent and less lively after the protracted trip. Staying awake all night, I was all the more thrilled at the thought of landing a veritable metropolis. With a warm glimpse of her lying on my side, I repeatedly told myself: please take good care of her, and be a man who will never shrink. Meanwhile, a message came, and it was from my dad. He had every confidence in our fresh start, “the morning must be terrific, so enjoy every single day.” I just knew that they are always right behind us.

So we got off, and a panorama of the charming city unfolded itself in front of us. Before we could fully appreciated the beauty of the teeming world, we were relieved to rent a place barely satisfactory thanks to ZH’s generosity, and remained sanguine about what might be in store. The following months proved to be mundane yet precious. It was definitely the first time we had lived together and looked after each other. Only when we had truly shared the same roof could we become more senstive to the habits and feelings.

Maybe it is incumbent for me to flaunt her in many regards and forgive me for the blatant happiness. Right now, I would be willing to present several virtuous qualities for the record.

I am fortunate enough to handle many excruciating challenges because she is a considerate and strategic adviser.

I am fortunate enough to get through the dark tunnel before the sun shines because she is a compassionate joy of mylife.

I am fortunate enough to taste aplethora of delicious delicacies because she is a great chef without doubt.

Myriads of enduring memories, it occurs to us, are no less fortuitous reminders of the restless youth than the vexatious harbingers of the implacable journey since we touched the magic land of Shanghai. Like every intrepid fighter who always stares down any disparaging judgement or discouraging outcome in his struggle of life, our story is no exception as well, inundated with intermingled feelings.

Frequently, I am taken to mull over the past experiences and dig into the submerged motivations that fires me up so far. One of the straightforward gists would be our inexorable faith of making a difference in the world despite of our insignificant presence. Still, the brutal law of survival of the fittest promulgated by Social Darwinism is so prevailing that we even feel powerless to confront ourselves when no one is around. Sense of inferiority and guilty take hold of our minds, repudiating every single achievement and crushing every original idea. We are then sunk into silence again… However, if we are to overturn the adverse mentality, it is a point of honour to remember: the most uncouth of our afflictions is to despite our being. Do keep fighting whenever we have the courage and strength to fight.

At least from my own perspective, “If Only”is not an excuse. This essay is a clear symptom of procrastination, which has invaded my self-defence mechanism and torn the habit long kept apart. Being manipulated by personal weaknesses in character stymies further insights and execution. Provided we are well cognizant of intricate humanity, chances of success are not thin altogether. While one’s piligrimage, untold and unspeakable, is destined to be buried inside, sharing with others could be a spontaneous reaction. The next time life does not crack a smile at us, pursue something that genuinely is interesting and forget the cumbersome tasks. A hand to hold, an ear to listen, or a heart to rest, the choice is all yours. 

Finally, the aniversary may live for a day, but will stay forever.

Wish Us Good Luck !

Hardly could I recall the day when the breaking news of Kobe Bryant's demise in a helicopter crash rushed in the morning.

I was awake and thumbed throughthe hot topics and the thunderbolt spread in the WeChat Moments. All of a sudden, I could not resist the hit of grief physically and mentally.

Never in my wildest imagination could I predict such a social memorial for a father and man. I checked again and again and would not believe a single word. As I digested and hid in the bathroom, crying like a kid who just lost his title in the examination.

It was real that Kobe and his daughter Gigi who was destined to a superstar after his father in the court left the world in such a horrible way.

What epitomizes the emotional turmoil the best is the moment when Michael Jordan gave his heartbreaking words at *A Celebration of Life* in the Staples Center.

> When Kobe Bryant died, a piece of me died. And as I look in this arena and across the globe, a piece of you died, or else you wouldn't be here. Those are the memories that we have to live with and we learn from.

In the last 35 days, I was convinced that many of you have gave your condolence and respect for the basketball legend.

In fact, as Kobe retired three years ago and I just missed the chance to see him in person.

When we tried to fathom his significance for our generation, he is definitely not just one of the idols.

The way he deals with life and competition in the court truly inspires us. He is all the more a hero that many of us loves and hates.

The conflict and struggle, the Mamba mentality, the gossip and trash words, they are all gone with only our respect and memorial.

He climbs the peak of his arena and like all our conventional idols, he is all the more frantic and inspirational in everything he does. Basketball is my beloved friend and everytime I enjoyed the moments in court, the hardships and setbacks fade away.

In his finale of his career, I still remembered the teeming shouts when he ended the game as usual, crashing the opponents' morale and earning the emblem no one could ever complete.

If only God would spare him andoffer him another chance to justify the deeds.

If only Kobe would shield Gigi and the torch would carry on to the next generation.

If only someone would reverse the sandglass.

The memorial of Kobe and his mentality reminds us of all the youth and blood and the spirit that we all had along the road.

Sadly, my dream of watching one of his basketball game turned into dust and a wishful thinking. It is now ornever.

Till today, I hate to say, life is such a troublemaker. Even though we have no power against the nature, it is the infinite game that the inspiration and spirit will constitute the founding blocks for higher aspirations.

**To be dead is not the end. To be forgotten is.**

To my enduring gratitude and respect.

Mamba Forever.

Proud to say I've surpassed my goal in this bull run.

Portfolio (+222%) outperforms $BTC (+116%).

We've all come a long way and it's better to know yourself early.

So I have lower expectations and just enjoy the Year of $SNEK.

Time to wrap up 2024.

## PORTFOLIO

I've underestimated what $BTC EFT will bring to the market in January and bought back higher.

$SNEK is my biggest conviction play after I thought everything through in April when the market was in red.

Already told my story before it took off.

Grateful I was give enough time to build my positions again.

Still kept a small position of USDT for the celebration of this 2024.

A part of that was tied to my position in Gamefi.

## TRADING

1. $BOME

Learned Solana memecoin craze from @TGTAlpha and hit another one with $BOME for 250 SOL (50x) in March.

After three sleepless nights, I was finally out of this craze.

It was the peak of the market when it was listed in @binance.

2. $DOG & Runestone

Runestone was airdropped and I bought more for $DOG.

Held through the top and tough days from March to December.

I decided to clear all position after $BTC broke 100k.

My previous theses are broken after the market moves.

Bitcoin can represent the Free and Fair movement and $DOG merely outperforms $BTC since inception.

Made a 2x after 8 months of hodling and buying the dip.

3. PYTH/TIA/PEPE/RONIN

I bought these narratives in February and sold all in May.

Expect for PEPE, it was an aweful experience holding these tokens and I fell for the hype.

Made a handsome profit from $PEPE.

4. Memecoin PVPs

I was wondering where it is the best place to bet.

Wandering in all SOL/BASE/BLAST/ETH ecosystems from April to June, I could hardly be the survivor after all the battles.

I did make profit from NIKE and OMNI in June as the memecoin craze was back on Cardano.

Turns out I was not fit for any of these schemes.

## AIRDROPS

1. $ENA

Lucky to participate in Season 1 and earned over 19k $ENA for over 10k USDT in April.

Had plans to hodl but after the suspicious activities from the team, I was out after a week.

Though it has some interesting designs, I stay away from this so-called gem.

2. $ME

Claimed my ME after multiple trades in Ordinal and Runes in December.

Sold my airdrop for another 9k USDT and put it back to $SNEK.

## DEFI

I was thrilled after I found out how to leverage @levvyfinance and @LenfiOfficial at the start of 2024.

It served me well when things were hot, but I was defeated by the defaults and market shift.

I reflected what I had in Cardano ecosystem and decided to stay out right before the rate cuts.

I also cut losses on $Lenfi / $HUNT / $CTV and sold all CNTs in April.

It was painful to hold any except for $SNEK.

## NFTs

I liquidated most assets again and only HODL what I love in July.

It's hard to swallow but I have to fight against my emotions.

After months of unrational decisions, we are just normal guys throwing money on things we love.  

I just don't wanna mess up this time.

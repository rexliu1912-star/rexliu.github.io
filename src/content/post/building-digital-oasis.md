## Introduction

What's the most meaningful gift you could give yourself?

For me, it wasn't something I could buy in a store or unwrap from a box. It was something I had been putting off for years—creating a digital home for all my scattered writings and thoughts from the past decade and a half.

Since my freshman year in college, I've been writing. But my content has been fragmented across various platforms, disappearing into the digital void. After stumbling upon a website-building guide, I had an epiphany: with AI advancing so rapidly, why couldn't I finally consolidate everything into one place I truly own?

This is the story of how I built my personal website in three days, the obstacles I encountered, and what I learned about "vibe coding" with AI.

## The Journey: From Idea to Reality

### Step 1: Planning with Purpose (The MRD/PRD Phase)

I started by having deep conversations with Gemini, transforming my vague idea into concrete documents—something akin to Market Requirements Documents (MRD) and Product Requirements Documents (PRD).

**But here's where I hit my first major roadblock.**

Despite my years as a product manager, I lacked deep knowledge of technical architecture and specialized platforms. I relied heavily on AI for answers, and initially, I took a wrong turn. Gemini suggested an "Astro + TinaCMS" combination that sent me down a rabbit hole.

I spent an entire weekend traveling and wrestling with TinaCMS, unable to break through. It wasn't until I re-fed the key points back to Gemini that I discovered the simpler, more elegant solution:

- **Astro** - Static site generator
- **GitHub** - Code hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated builds
- **GitHub Pages** - Website hosting
- **Cloudflare** - CDN and domain management

**Lesson learned**: When working with AI, if you're stuck, don't be afraid to restart the conversation with clearer context.

### Step 2: Building the Foundation

Once I understood the correct architecture, I moved methodically:

1. Installed the standard Astro template
2. Connected to GitHub
3. Wrote and pushed my first article
4. Secured my personal domain—rexliu.io (at $45/year for long-term display)
5. Bound the domain to GitHub Pages

Monday afternoon, approximately two hours later, everything was connected. When I saw my first article live on my own domain, the joy was indescribable.

### Step 3: Designing the User Experience

Tuesday brought a new challenge: redesigning the frontend.

I gave Gemini my final directive: "Rex Liu's Minimalist Life Essays Collection" was entering Version 2.0.

I panicked initially, thinking I'd have to start over with a completely new design. But Gemini offered a solution that saved me: instead of rebuilding from scratch, I could simply swap out the content engine to Astro Cactus—a minimalist theme that perfectly matched my vision.

**Another crucial discovery**: Version control is your safety net. Whenever the frontend threw errors, I could simply roll back. This feature provided immense peace of mind. Imagine losing everything at the finish line—the frustration would have been unbearable.

By afternoon, I had resolved most issues and successfully pushed everything to my live website. That moment of accomplishment? Pure bliss.

## My Core Requirements (And How I Met Them)

✅ **Content consolidation** - All my writings now have a permanent home

✅ **Psychological satisfaction** - The pride of building something myself

✅ **Data and code ownership** - Complete control over my digital presence

✅ **Alignment with my rebirth journey** - A fresh start with deep roots

## The Complete Vibe Coding Philosophy

Through this three-day journey—the first two days stumbling, the third accelerating—I developed a framework for successful AI-assisted coding:

### 1. **Plan Your Architecture Before Starting**
Think through your implementation and confirm the architecture before diving in. Avoid repetitive, wasted effort. The time you spend planning will save you double the time debugging.

### 2. **Save Important Documents Constantly**
Long conversations with AI can lead to "hallucinations" or context drift. Both Claude and Gemini helped me tremendously here, but I learned to save critical information externally.

### 3. **Use Cursor for Local Editing**
Copy and paste code directly rather than letting the AI auto-generate within the chat. This gives you more control and prevents unexpected "creative liberties."

### 4. **Embrace Incremental Progress**
Learn to roll back and save frequently. Add one feature at a time. Don't try to accomplish everything in one heroic push.

### 5. **Done Is Better Than Perfect**
This principle carried me through. I awakened memories that had been sleeping for years. I remembered how I once needed programmer friends for every little feature. Now, I can solve problems myself.

## Your Turn: What Will You Build?

Building this website wasn't just about creating a digital presence—it was about reclaiming ownership of my story.

I uploaded my first public article from 2009 and other milestone pieces, creating annotations for my reimagined life. These weren't just old posts; they were chapters of who I've become.

**Here's my challenge to you**: What have you been putting off because it seemed too technical, too complex, or too time-consuming? What would having your own digital space mean for you?

The barriers that once seemed insurmountable—coding knowledge, technical expertise, expensive developers—have dramatically lowered. AI tools don't replace human creativity; they amplify it.

## Final Thoughts

The best birthday gift I gave myself wasn't the website itself. It was the confidence that comes from building something with my own hands (and a little AI assistance).

It was the satisfaction of knowing that my words, my thoughts, my journey now have a home that I control—not at the mercy of platform algorithms or corporate decisions.

It was the realization that in 2024, anyone with determination and curiosity can bring their digital visions to life.

**What will your gift to yourself be?**

Start with one small step. Have a conversation with an AI assistant. Sketch out your vision. And remember: completion beats perfection every single time.

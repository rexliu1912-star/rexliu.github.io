The world just keeps going up.

I went down a rabbit hole on this and here's what I found: it's about money printing. The debasement trade.

Governments are trapped. They can't stop printing because the alternative is admitting the system is broken.

So here's the situation:

Your dollar loses value every year. Gold hits records. Bitcoin rallies. Bonds get dumped because people are finally realizing that holding cash might actually be the riskiest thing you can do.

This used to sound like conspiracy stuff. Now it's what hedge funds are doing.

The move is obvious but most people still won't make it. Get out of pure cash positions. Buy things they can't print more of. Gold. Silver. Real estate. Bitcoin if you can handle the volatility.

Ray Dalio recommends 10-15% in these assets. Not because everything will collapse next week, but because slow monetary debasement destroys your wealth over decades.

Will this work? Maybe not.

But do you actually believe governments buried in debt will suddenly stop spending and tighten their belts? Or will they keep choosing the path of least resistance?

I'm positioning for the latter so I'm loading up more on GOLD and Bitcoin for allocation.

Understanding the logic won't guarantee profits. But you'll actually grasp how fast everything is shifting right now.

What's your hedge in this new era?

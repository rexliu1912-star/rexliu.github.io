## The Setup

My mother has bipolar disorder.

Not the dramatic Hollywood version. The real kind—thirty years of cycles, some measured in months, others in years. The kind where you learn to read the weather patterns of another person's mind, never knowing which version of them you'll get at breakfast.

The decade after I graduated college was our quiet window. Her longest stable period since I was a child. I thought we'd earned something. That maybe, finally, the tide had gone out for good.

I was wrong.

## The Fall

At sixty, the brain can't buffer what it used to.

The episodes last longer now. The recovery is thinner. The person who emerges on the other side is slightly less herself than before.

I watch her struggle and feel two things at once: grief and rage. Grief for what she's losing. Rage at my own helplessness. Neither emotion helps her. Neither helps me.

This New Year home, I realized something I didn't want to admit: the mother I knew—the one from that stable decade—isn't coming back. We're in a new phase now. One where I need to be the buffer, the processor, the one who carries what she can't.

## The Break

I've rationalized this for years.

COVID broke something in all of us, but it fractured something specific in her. The isolation, the disruption to routine, the generalized anxiety of those years—it found the cracks in her foundation and widened them.

Last year, I bottomed out harder than I wanted to admit. The depression I'd managed for years finally caught up. There were days I didn't want to get out of bed. Days I understood, in a way I never had before, why some people choose to exit early.

Not because they don't love their families. Not because they're selfish.

Because the weight becomes mathematically unbearable. Because you start doing the calculus: years of suffering ahead vs. the pain you'd cause by leaving. And some days, the math almost makes sense.

I didn't. Obviously. I'm here, writing this.

But I understand now why my mother cycles the way she does. Why the brain, when overloaded, starts looking for emergency exits. Why sometimes the only response to overwhelming pain is to shut down, dissociate, disappear into the fog.

## The Lesson

Here's what nobody tells you about watching a parent age:

**You're not just losing them. You're becoming them.**

I see my mother's patterns in myself now. The cycles of energy and collapse. The tendency to buffer overwhelming emotion with shutdown. The way stress manifests not as anxiety but as dissociation—as checking out because checking in hurts too much.

The brutal truth is this: genetics is probability, not destiny. But probability compounds over time. And at forty, I'm starting to see the compound interest on whatever genetic and environmental factors shaped her brain.

## What I'm Doing Differently

I can't fix my mother. The medical system can't either—not fully, not permanently.

But I can build systems that might keep me from following the same trajectory.

**Physical buffer:** Exercise isn't optional anymore. It's maintenance. The days I move are the days I can think clearly.

**Social buffer:** Isolation is the enemy. I need people who can see me clearly, who can tell me when I'm cycling, when I'm starting to drift.

**Cognitive buffer:** Meditation, therapy, medication when needed. Tools to process what my mother's brain couldn't.

**Time buffer:** The most precious resource. Saying no to things that don't matter so I have capacity for what does. Being present with my daughter in a way my mother often couldn't be with me.

## The Weight

You think acceptance comes with age.

It doesn't. You just get different at carrying the weight.

My mother carried hers for thirty years before the structure started to fail. I've been carrying mine for twenty. I have time to build better foundations, but not unlimited time.

Every year, the weight gets heavier or my capacity gets stronger. There's no third option.

## What I'm Building

This is why I write. Why I share. Why I build in public.

Not because I have answers. Because I'm searching for them in real-time, and maybe my search helps someone else's.

The systems I'm building—financial, physical, cognitive, social—aren't just for me. They're for my daughter. So she doesn't have to watch me fade the way I'm watching my mother fade.

So she doesn't have to feel that particular grief-rage combination at forty. Or thirty. Or ever.

## The Question

I don't know what this year will bring. Whether my mother will stabilize again or continue this slow drift. Whether I'll maintain my own systems or let them decay under pressure.

I don't know if "happily ever after" is a real thing or just a narrative convenience.

But I know this: the work matters. The daily, unglamorous work of maintenance. Of showing up. Of building systems that can carry more than you think you can bear.

**How do you hold your weight?**

I'm genuinely asking. Because I'm still learning. Still building. Still here.

Stay Invested in the Game. 🐍

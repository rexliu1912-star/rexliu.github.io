I sold my house two years ago and went back to renting.

Best financial decision I ever made.

Bought it in 2018 before getting married because that's what you're supposed to do, right? Thought we finally had a home in the metropolis. Reality? It was in the suburbs with over an hour commute each way. I barely lived there but had happy memories during covid.

In 2023 we talked and agreed to sell. Within a week we called agents, spent the weekend negotiating with buyers, and signed. Done.

The mortgage was crushing us. Why keep an illiquid asset that's constantly losing value when you could have cash and actually breathe? Since we sold, that place has dropped another 15 percent. The entire Chinese real estate market is going through this right now.

People thought we were crazy. We had a two year old kid. What about schools? What about stability?

But here's what I learned: the most important asset isn't property. It's having the freedom and resources to take care of your family however you need to.

These past two years I've been living closer to the digital nomad life I always dreamed about. Sounds idealistic maybe, especially coming from someone in crypto. But I'll be actually doing it in a few days.

Will I buy again someday? Maybe.

But you have to experience a bigger world first before you know what you actually want versus what everyone tells you to want.

***Have you ever made a decision that everyone around you questioned but turned out to be right for you?***

Today is the third time we've moved this year.

Packing makes you want to burn everything you own. Honestly, it stresses me out more than watching my portfolio down.

Moving taught me something huge:

We own so much useless stuff. You think you'll need it someday. You won't. Half the time you forget you even bought it.

Just like most of your wallets look like digital graveyards. Tokens bought at the peak just sitting there, reminding you of every bad decision. They took your money and gave you nothing back. Not even hopium.

So I desire to simplify life. This year I'm actually doing it.

Our plan is to live in a different city every three months and travel around China with my little girl. We still need some stability for educational stuff, so we're keeping it structured.

The goal is to travel everywhere before my girl starts elementary school.

We may even be travelling all around the word in a few years.

Let's see what happens this time.

Recently @snek launches a viral community engagement campaign on X.

It involves transforming holders' or influencers' profile pictures (PFPs) into customized, snek-themed artwork.

The campaign primarily targets $SNEK holders, #Cardano ecosystem enthusiasts, and crypto influencers to foster organic virality and community loyalty. 

It starts with @snek affiliate accounts and has sparked playful envy and calls for more, reinforcing $SNEK's fun, grassroots vibe.

You may be curious how it all happens and why brand matters.

Kudos to @Warrr9A for these amazing pieces.

It's addictive to remain who you are while being Snekified 🐍

I've seen more beautiful AI generated works and it's really fun to explore.

I believe one has to be forward-looking and learn from the best projects all the time.

The wildfire that @pudgypenguins ignited in viral marketing has led more changes in memes.

It not only defines your investment, your online identity, but also surrounds the physical world with licensing and IP.

$SNEK can definitely mirror Pudgy's playbook to evolve from memecoin to enduring brand 🔥

I watched Pudgy Penguins PFPs take over my timeline today.

Made me think about @snek's recent campaign. We've created 64 custom Snekified PFPs. Built anticipation. Created something special.

But here's the thing that hit me: a third of those acoounts never actually switched.

That stung at first. Then I realized we could have done much better.

The real move is to focus on SNEK believers. The ones who already rep Snek daily. The holders who find creative ways to weave it into their lives. The community members who treat it like an actual identity, not a temporary trend.

Capital games aren't that complicated. It's basically buying some ads on people's profiles like Pudgy Penguins. Sure, those viral movements create noise and expand reach.

But sustainable value? That comes from depth, not breadth.

When someone genuinely wants to represent your project, that means something. When they don't, your custom artwork is wasted effort.

So here's my take: we need to shift direction immediately. Make exclusive PFPs for people who've earned them. Reward consistent voices. Build for quality over quantity.

The more people who genuinely value Snek as part of their identity, the more valuable Snek becomes.

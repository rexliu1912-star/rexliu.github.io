Another ending of a school year.

It is three days before returning home. The current reality is I can not precisely give an explan­ation as to why I am lingering over this place. For a large part, I have intended to go back home with one of my friends, through which I can absorb certain knowledge about how to copy with traveling along the way. Most of my past life were guided under others' wings and this time all I need is courage as well as confidence. When I informed my parents of my decision, it was not comforting to them, as I would be exposed to the night, which was kind of dangerous in their eyes. By assuring that I could manage to simply get it done, they let go of me. Sensing their anxiety over the phone, I was determined to have a go by myself .

Nonetheless, things prove to be more complicated after those wonderful sprees we all guys had been obseesd with. Wierdly, solitude is piercing my heart no matter how hard I want to escape.

Switching rooms came ahead, and to me, say, disappointment was overwhelming; but the bond never die. "Bros for life !" was inspiring with a different meaning. At the same time, after the class get-together several days ago, where we were delightedly indulging ourselves with endless cheers, it is the first time our class united as one, ignoring what impressions we had left in school. With several rounds of beer served, my head began to spin. But in front of everyone, I had to stay conscious all the time. After all, it was also the last one chance. Being spectacular, the MTV showdown once again traced everyone's unusual road in the past year. Intoxication was all over us. Proudly, I claim myself to be one of Our Glorious Class Four. Our class is not an obscurity regardless of evaluation from outside. In short, many thanks to all my classmates for everything we had shared. Benevolence will spring up as long as we keep chasing the initial ambitions in our hearts.

Emptiness floods inside these days. Wandering alone, I am senstive to the surroundings. I still can not have a clue with my mind unsettling. Saviouring such a life the hard way, which I have never encountered before. Constantly, I was beaten by the thought and admitted that hope blew me off. The more efforts I put in recovering, the less intact my life is. What I am trying to do is to dissipate loneliness and seek the lost self. But right now this feeling hurts every time I recollect those beautiful momeries. Perhaps the best option for me is to leave it to Time, as we all concede that Time is the best medicine that heals all wounds.

Been There, Done That! Conclusion for my freshmen year ...

Being someone truly alive. Dreams of the future...
